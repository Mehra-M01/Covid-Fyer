# Covid-Fyer

The CoronaVirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARSCoV-2) and is highly transmissible. It came into China governmentâ€™s notice in December, 2019 in Wuhan and
more than twenty five million people all over the world were affected by it. Coronavirus is challenging all the
people and the technology on the entire planet. As of August 2022, there are more than 27 million COVID-19
cases and 873,000 deaths globally .People with low immunity, old age, and medical issues especially associated
with lungs are more vulnerable to COVID-19 sickness. The symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, cold, high fever
and respiration issues. Preventive measures for COVID-19 square m measure to shield oneself by washing
hands off, avoid touching mouth, eyes, nose and face, and by maintaining social distance with others.

The methodology used is transfer learning which is a deep learning
technique. We used the GoogleNet model of transfer learning. The data
set used for this is a public dataset available [9]. This data set consists
chest xray images of both COVID-19 and normal patients, in which there
are 912 x-ray images of each correspondingly .Below figures (a) and (b)
shows the sample chest x-rays of both COVID-19 and normal patients.
The distinct observations from X-ray images of COVID-19 infected from
the other X-rays are the lower lobes, and the posterior segments, with a
fundamentally peripheral and subpleural distribution. These
observations are evident in both the lungs even in the early stages.
Deep learning models use artificial neural networks arranged in multiple
layers. The layers are composed of nodes called perceptrons. A node
takes inputs from the information with respective coefficients or
weights that amplify or dampen the inputs, thereby distributing
amplified/dampened inputs to output nodes. The structure of the
network and nodes in the network can be varied with reference to the
task.
